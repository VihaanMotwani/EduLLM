# Supervised Learning

## Summary
Supervised learning is a machine learning method that trains models using **labeled data**—where each input comes with a correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs, enabling it to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

For example, to train an algorithm to recognize pictures of cats, you feed it many images labeled as "cat" or "not cat."

## Key Concepts

- **Labeled Dataset:** Data where each input example has an associated correct output (label).
- **Training vs Testing:**  
  - *Training:* The model learns patterns from the labeled data.  
  - *Testing:* The model’s performance is evaluated on unseen data.
- **Regression vs Classification:**  
  - *Regression* predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).  
  - *Classification* predicts discrete categories (e.g., spam or not spam).

## Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression:** Predicts continuous output using a linear function.
- **Decision Trees:** Uses tree-like models of decisions and outcomes.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** Classifies data points based on the classes of their neighbors.

## Real-World Example

Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, and location. The model learns from historical sales data with known prices and predicts prices for new houses.

## FAQs

- **Q:** What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?  
  **A:** Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds patterns or groupings in **unlabeled** data.

- **Q:** What are some common applications of supervised learning?  
  **A:** Email spam detection, image classification, speech recognition, and predicting house prices.

- **Q:** How do you evaluate a supervised learning model?  
  **A:** Using metrics such as:  
  - *Classification:* accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
  - *Regression:* mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared

# Neural Networks

## Summary
Neural networks are machine learning models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data.

## Key Concepts
- Input layer, hidden layers, output layer
- Weights, biases, activation functions
- Feedforward and backpropagation

## Real-World Example
Image recognition, like identifying cats vs dogs in photos.

## FAQs
**Q:** Why are they called “neural” networks?  
**A:** Because they loosely mimic the structure of the human brain’s neurons and connections.

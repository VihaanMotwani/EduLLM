# Neural Networks

## Summary
Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the **structure and function of the human brain**. They are designed to recognize complex patterns in data through layers of interconnected nodes, called **neurons**.

Neural networks are the foundation of **deep learning** and are widely used in tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

## Key Concepts

- **Neuron:** A basic processing unit that receives input, applies a function, and passes output.
- **Layers:**
  - **Input Layer:** Receives raw data.
  - **Hidden Layers:** Perform transformations and pattern extraction.
  - **Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction or classification.
- **Weights & Biases:** Values adjusted during training to improve accuracy.
- **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
- **Feedforward:** Data flows from input to output.
- **Backpropagation:** The process of adjusting weights by minimizing prediction error using gradient descent.

## Real-World Example

In **image recognition**, a neural network can be trained to identify whether a photo contains a cat or a dog. It does so by learning patterns like edges, shapes, and textures through its hidden layers. Over time, it can classify unseen images with high accuracy.

## Advantages

- Can model very complex relationships in data
- Effective for unstructured data (images, text, audio)
- Scales well with large datasets (especially deep networks)

---

## Limitations

- Requires large amounts of labeled data
- Computationally expensive to train
- Less interpretable than simpler models (i.e., “black box”)

## FAQs

- **Q:** Why are they called “neural” networks?  
  **A:** Because they loosely mimic how neurons in the human brain process and transmit information.

- **Q:** What's the difference between a neural network and deep learning?  
  **A:** Deep learning refers to neural networks with **many hidden layers**, capable of learning higher-level features.

- **Q:** What kind of problems are neural networks good at solving?  
  **A:** Tasks like image classification, language translation, speech recognition, and even game-playing (e.g., AlphaGo).

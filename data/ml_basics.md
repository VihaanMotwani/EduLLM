# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Summary
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Instead of being told exactly what to do, a machine learning model improves its performance over time by **learning from examples**.

## Key Concepts

- **Learning from data:** ML systems improve through experience (i.e., more data = better performance).
- **Features:** Input variables or characteristics (e.g., age, temperature).
- **Labels:** Correct answers (used in supervised learning).
- **Model:** The learned function that maps inputs to outputs.
- **Training & Testing:** Data is split to train the model and then test its accuracy.
- **Generalization:** The ability of a model to perform well on unseen data, not just what it was trained on.

## Real-World Example

A postal service uses machine learning to **automatically recognize handwritten ZIP codes**.  
The system is trained on thousands of digit images and learns to identify patterns that distinguish 0–9.  
Once trained, it can accurately read new, unseen handwriting.

Other simple examples:
- Spam filters
- Movie recommendations
- Stock price prediction

## Types of Machine Learning (Brief Overview)

- **Supervised Learning:** Learns from labeled data (e.g., house price prediction).
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns by trial and error using rewards and penalties (e.g., game-playing bots).

## Advantages

- Adaptability: ML models can adapt as new data is introduced.
- Automation: Reduces need for manual rule creation.
- Scalability: Can handle massive datasets.

## Challenges

- Requires large and clean datasets
- May be biased if trained on biased data
- Lack of interpretability in some models (black box)

## FAQs

**Q:** What’s the difference between AI and ML?  
**A:** AI is the broader goal of creating smart machines. ML is a specific method that teaches machines to learn from data.

**Q:** Is Machine Learning the same as statistics?  
**A:** ML and statistics overlap, but ML focuses more on prediction and automation, while statistics focuses more on inference and explanation.

**Q:** Can I do ML without coding?  
**A:** Some tools offer no-code ML platforms, but understanding code (e.g., Python) is useful for deeper work.

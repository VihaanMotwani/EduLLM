# Reinforcement Learning

## Summary
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by interacting with an **environment**. The agent receives **rewards** or **penalties** based on its actions and aims to maximize cumulative reward over time.

Unlike supervised learning, RL learns from **trial and error** without explicit correct answers.

## Key Concepts

- **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker (e.g., a robot, game player).  
- **Environment:** The world the agent interacts with.  
- **Reward:** Feedback signal (positive or negative) indicating the success of an action.  
- **Policy:** A strategy that maps states of the environment to actions.  
- **Exploration vs Exploitation:**  
  - *Exploration* means trying new actions to discover their effects.  
  - *Exploitation* means choosing the best-known action to maximize rewards.

## Real-World Example

Teaching a robot to walk by rewarding it when it moves forward without falling. Over many trials, the robot learns the best actions to walk steadily.

Other examples include:
- Training game-playing AI like AlphaGo.
- Autonomous vehicle navigation.
- Personalized recommendations that adapt over time.

## FAQs

**Q:** How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?  
**A:** Supervised learning learns from labeled data with correct answers; reinforcement learning learns from **rewards and penalties** received after actions, without direct labels.

**Q:** What is the exploration-exploitation trade-off?  
**A:** Itâ€™s the balance between trying new actions to learn more (*exploration*) and using known actions that yield high rewards (*exploitation*).

**Q:** Can reinforcement learning be used in real-world applications?  
**A:** Yes, in robotics, gaming, autonomous driving, and adaptive systems.

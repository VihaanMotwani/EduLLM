# Unsupervised Learning

## Summary
Unsupervised learning uses data without labels. The model tries to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.

## Key Concepts
- No labeled outputs
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Discovering structure in data

## Common Algorithms
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

## Real-World Example
Grouping customers by shopping behavior to target promotions.

## FAQs
**Q:** Can unsupervised learning make predictions?  
**A:** Not directly — it groups or explores data, but doesn’t label or predict known outputs.

# Unsupervised Learning

## Summary
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model works with **unlabeled data**. Instead of predicting specific outputs, it tries to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures in the data. Itâ€™s useful for exploratory analysis, pattern recognition, and data compression.

## Key Concepts

- **No labeled outputs:** The data does not have predefined labels or categories.
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segments).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features while preserving important information (e.g., PCA).
- **Discovering structure:** Finding natural groupings or features in data.

## Common Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering:** Partitions data into K groups by minimizing distance within clusters.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a tree of clusters by progressively merging or splitting groups.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto principal components that capture the most variance.

## Real-World Example

Retailers use unsupervised learning to **group customers** based on their shopping behavior. These clusters help target promotions more effectively to different customer segments.

## FAQs

**Q:** Can unsupervised learning make predictions?  
**A:** Not directly. It finds patterns or groups in data but does not predict predefined labels or outcomes.

**Q:** When is unsupervised learning useful?  
**A:** For exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and data visualization.
